# Week 1 - Progressors

If you're here, you're tracking with the concepts, but seek opportunities to further **enhance your understanding and skills**.  We provide additional exercises and challenges to help you solidify your understanding of the material and build your skills.  If you haven't already, also check out the [Primers conents](../1-primers/), which explains the concepts in a slightly different way from the course content.

The below concepts are not covered in the course work, but they are quite important.

- [Function Expressions](./1-function-expressions/README.md)
- [Arrow Functions](./2-arrow-functions/README.md)
